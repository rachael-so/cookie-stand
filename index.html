    <p>
      Salmon Cookies are a combination of two of Seattle's favorite things: coffee-time confection and salmon. These cookies not only take the shape of salmon, but also are made of salmon! The fish are finely grinded as to get rid of the fishy taste. These cookies are the perfect compliment to a nice cup of coffee and friendly chats. These cookies are also great suveniors as they can only be found around Seattle!
